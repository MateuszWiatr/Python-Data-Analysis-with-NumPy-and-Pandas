## The Maven MegaMart Course Project
Act as a newly hired Data Analyst for Maven MegaMart, a multinational corporation that operates a chain of retail and grocery stores.

**Mid-Course Project** - Maven Acquisition Target Data
**Final Project** - Maven Acquisition Target Data
They recently received a sample of data from a new retailer they're looking to acquire, and they need you to identify and deliver key insights about their sales history.

The assignment is to analyze over 2 million transactions by product, household, and store to get a better understanding of the retailer's main strengths. From there, we need to review the company's discount scheme to assess whether they can expect to attract customers without losing margin.

Use Python to:
Read in multiple flat files efficiently
Join tables to prove a single source of information
Shape & aggregate sales data to calculate KPIs
Visualize the data to communicate findings
